# python-Automotive-Auto-Lighting

In 2020, a fun project I created using python. The project's main goal was to detect light during driving car and open the lights of the car.

To accomplish this, the project used opencv and numpy used. This is not a real time system instead a video file need to be uploaded. however the functions can be used in real time systems.

The project was generated and tested using Visual Studio 15, and the license is MIT.
