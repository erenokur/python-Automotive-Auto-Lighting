# python-Automotive-Auto-Lighting

In 2020, a fun project I created using python. The project's main goal was to detect light during driving car and open the lights of the car.

To accomplish this, the project used opencv and numpy used. This is not a real time system instead a video file need to be uploaded. however the functions can be used in real time systems.

this project also has ability to show realtime response with microconroller systems. When open light responde microcontroller opens its leds and closes when respond was close. There also long light and short light option and thats visible on the microcontroller system.
